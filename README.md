# Java Error Handling 

## üìò Description
The Java-Error-Handling repository provides an in-depth exploration of exception handling in Java. This repository is ideal for developers who want to master Java's error handling mechanisms through practical examples and exercises.

Key topics covered:

- Checked vs. Unchecked Exceptions: Learn the differences and when to use each type.
- Custom Exceptions: Create and handle custom exception classes.
- Try-Catch-Finally: Understand structured error handling in Java.
- Exception Chaining: Explore how exceptions can be linked to provide better debugging information.

## üóÇÔ∏è Project Structure
The project is organized for easy learning and experimentation:

### Main Files
### src/
This folder contains Java source code covering key error handling concepts:

- Aluno.java: Represents a simple student class used in validation tests.
- Basico.java: Demonstrates fundamental try-catch mechanisms.
- Causa.java: Showcases exception chaining using the cause of exceptions.
- ChecadaVsNaoChecada.java: Explains the difference between checked and unchecked exceptions.
- Finally.java: Demonstrates the importance of the finally block in exception handling.

### Custom Exception Handling (Package CustomA & CustomB)

- NumeroForaIntervaloException.java: Custom exception for handling out-of-range numbers.
- StringVaziaException.java: Custom exception for handling empty strings.
- TesteValidacoes.java: Test class for validating input using custom exceptions.
